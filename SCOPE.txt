Brange is a Yelp-like clone. There are four parts to this project:

1) Creating Static Components
2) Passing Information to Components
3) Setting the State of the Brange Components
4) Interacting with the Yelp API

Brange is composed of four different components (./src/components/) interacting 
with each other:
<Business />
<BusinessList />
<SearchBar />
<App /> (created by default with create-react-app...)


User Requirements:
1) As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
2) As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
3) As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter
